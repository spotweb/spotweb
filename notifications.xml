			<title>Installer changes</title>
			<description><![CDATA[Spotweb now contains an installer (install.php). In order to be able to safely support this (eg: not every user should be able to run this for an already installed Spotweb) and to allow for multiple type of installations within Spotweb this requires some manual intervention.
				<br />
			First, you need to remove the database information from your "ownsettings.php" file for now. You can either run the Spotweb installation wizard (recommended way) but this will create a new user and reset group membership for all users. An alternative way is to create an own <i>dbsettings.inc.php</i> file. Please consult the <a href="https://github.com/spotweb/spotweb/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions">Spotweb wiki</a> for more information about creating this dbsettings.inc.php file.

			<title>Systemwide Custom CSS</title>
			<description><![CDATA[Users could already specify their own CustomCSS but for some multi-user systems a systemwide
				custom CSS would be more interesting. Support for this has been added but it requires a small update to the 
				settings database table hence this notice.

			<title>Security group reset</title>
			<description><![CDATA[The balance between an open Spotweb system and an closed Spotweb system is always a conflict of interest during several types of Spotweb users. 
			<br /><br />
			In order to facilitate this better, the default Spotweb security groups have been changed adding two types of groups: "Trusted users" and "Anonymous user - closed system",
			these groups allow you to support more finegrained security permissions without tinkering too much with the settings in Spotweb.
			<br /><br />
			Unfortunately this means we have to reset all security groups within Spotweb - this means that if you customized any security settings within Spotweb that you have to check
			the system does not respond any differently than you want.
			<br /><br />
			If you want a closed system, please remove the "Anonymous" user from the "Anonymous user - open system" group, and add it to the "Anonymous user - closed system" securitygroup.

			<title>Quick Links linked to user preferences</title>
			<description><![CDATA[A requested feature has finally been implemented: de linking of Quick Links to user preferences. If you change personal
			preferences, quicklinks should be shown or hidden along with those preferences.<br />
			If you have quicklinks set manually in your (own)settings.php, they need to be updated in this version. Otherwise everything goes automaticlly.

			<title>Optimized spotcounting</title>
			<description><![CDATA[One of the slowest parts of Spotweb was the counting of new spots in the filterlist. This counting was this slow, that 
			when a certain amount of spots were exceeded, Spotweb would refrain from counting any newer spots to prevent hanging pages.
			<br /> <br />
			In this new version Spotweb uses a slightly less accurate, but much faster, method to determine which spots are new. This requires a very small
			schema change which will not take a long time to process. <br /> <br />
			After the database upgrade, a retrieve.php run should be done. This first retrieve run might take a very long time to complete as initial statistics
			are gathered at that moment. From then on, a very small retrieve.php impact might be shown but should be neglectable. Spotcounts however are not
			limited anymore and should be much faster.<br />

			<title>Introducing settings panel</title>
			<description><![CDATA[All major settings are now set on the Settings panel inside Spotweb. The database upgrade will be very fast, but you will

			<title>Keeping the IP address for a session</title>
			<description><![CDATA[In the Spotweb session database table we now keep the IP address of the user which created the session.<br /> This requires a
			database upgrade which should be done rather quick unless your sessions table is very large (which is unlikely).
