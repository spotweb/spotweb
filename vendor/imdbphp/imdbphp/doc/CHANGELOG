-------------------
! `Title::yearspan()` - returned the incorrect end year sometimes
! `Title::mpaa_reason()`, `Title::parentalGuide()`, `Title::extReviews()`, `Title::languages_detailed()`, `Title::cast()`
! `Title::releaseInfo()` returning the wrong day/month #103

-------------------

+ but since we had a working storyline, that method was added as storyline()
! imdb::mainPictures() was also broken by the last site changes - fixed

  year, e.g. something like "2001/II")

  comment, comment_split, tagline, plotoutline, keywords, mpaa, mpaa_hist, mpaa_reason, prodNotes

  then also added pilot::awards() as wrapper to it (requires FULL_ACCESS)

  if it was not defined before

  (http://www.moviepilot.de/), supporting some movie functionality only

! imdb_person::filmograf was broken due to an inserted onClick() on IMDB.COM
* imdb_person::movies_actress() was causing false alert in tests
! fixed the imdb::trailers() method. Note that IMDB now only lists their own
  videos, so the imdb_trailers class is (currently) useless.
- removed the imdb_trailers class from checks. As IMDB seems to no longer
  list external trailers, they will either fail. The code for the class will
  remain in the repository for now - one never knows...

  compatibility, pilot:keywords_all() has been added (aliases pilot::keywords())

  files on the system
+ added version and revision info to the classes (to be shown with the test page
  results)
+ let the test page prepend "." and ".." to PHPs include_path so it runs out of

-------------------
! preventing endless loops on connection problems (i.e. IMDB site offline)
! failed pages are no longer cached
+ added the attribute lastServerResponse (3-digit codes according to RFC2616)
  to the imdb_base class. You can check this to find out why there have been
  no results - e.g. "404" means the page was not found. "000" usually means
